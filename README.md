# Graphic Viewer

Graphic Viewer is a small, fast, free image display program for Windows.

Graphic Viewer supports BMP, CUR, GIF, GROB, ICO, JPG, PCX, PPM, TGA, and TIF format images.  Files do not need the correct extension for GV to recognize and read them.  If you have Python and PIL installed on your system, additional formats (such as PNG) are supported, too.
