4/7/17:
 Change: Now freeware -- removed all shareware functions

 Change: Now under the Apache 2 license.
 Change: Removed Twain functions (scanner interface functions).

10/19/05:

1/13/05:
 Bug fix: JPEGs with a single channel that had a minimum codiung unit other
  than 1 would not be read properly.

1/11/05:
 Improvement: Some JPGs with conflicting surplus data after them are now
  loaded.

12/30/04:
 Improvement: More variations of T6 TIFF files can be read.

  view area settings according to preferences.
 Bug fix: Image preview would sometimes crash on greyscale images.

5/8/04:
 Feature: Typing F10 now toggles between maximized, full screen, and normal
  window sizes.

3/13/04:
 Feature: Can now read TIFF compression mode 2 (CCITT RLE).

12/18/03 - Official 1.12 release

12/17/03:
 Bug fix: JPEGs with incorrect application tag lengths could cause the
  program to crash.

12/9/03:
 Improvement: Better handling of images with sizes >32767 pixels in either
  width or height.

10/8/03:
 Improvement: Sort now maintains the order of identical items.

 Bug fix: When saving a 24 bit image as a 24 bit icon or cursor, the picture
  in memory would become corrupted.

6/12/03:
 Improvement: Linking extensions now supports XP.

1/7/03 - Official 1.10 release

1/7/03:
 Bug fix: When all of the files in a directory are deleted from a slide show,
  the program would crash.

 Bug fix: When outputting 256 color icon files, one color was occasionally
  altered.

5/28/02:
 Feature: Batch convert will now handle save all parts of a multi-image file
  if the appropriate options are so selected.

5/6/02:
 Improvement: JPEGs with nearly white areas are written more precisely.

4/11/02:
 Feature: The JPEG save routines can now write just the JPEG header data or
  just the JPEG image data.  This is useful for constructing limited-header
  flash files.

1/10/02:
 Improvement: Palettization with a transparent color is now better.

12/20/01 - Official 1.09 release

12/20/01:
 Bug fix: CCITT Group 3 (T4) TIF files were offset if the line length wasn't
  a multiple of 8 pixels.
 Bug fix: The last save directory was not always remembered properly.
 Improvement: On systems with more that 8 bit per pixel displays, palettized
  images are now interpolated if interpolation is turned on.  This is slower,
  but looks better.
 Feature: Bicubic interpolation menu item added.
 Feature: Added 'DefaultSaveDir' option to the INI file.  If this is not
  blank, then all save directories are changed to this whenever the program
  starts.
 Feature: Added First Image, Previous Image, and Next Image menu items for
  ease in viewing images in multi-image files.
 Feature: Typing F10 toggles between maximized and normal window sizes.
 Feature: Added Save All Parts menu item.  When a multi-image file is saved
  to a format that supports multiple images, the whole image is saved, and
  this option is selected, then all parts of the image are saved in the
  original order, regardless of which part is currently being viewed.

12/12/01:
 Bug fix: Very small palettized bitmaps didn't load properly.

 Feature: Supports reading progressive JPEGs
 Feature: There is a 'Keep' option in the GIF save options.  This maintains
  the previous image in an animated gif, allowing transparency in later
  images to be used to improve the compression.

10/4/00 - Official 1.06 release

10/4/00:
 Feature: Supports Group 3 and Group 4 CCITT compressed TIF files.
